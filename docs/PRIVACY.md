# Privacy

Short version: signed out, the editor never sends your diagrams anywhere
unless you make a short link; signed in, it keeps them in your account
(private, and you can turn that off). There are no analytics or tracking
scripts, no cookies for counting and nothing that follows you; the site only
counts, per day, how often a few things happen (say, "the editor was opened
412 times on 6 October"), with nothing about who. An account is optional (for
practice, short links and keeping your diagrams across devices), and an email
address is kept only if you ask for email reminders. The rest of this page
lists exactly what is kept, where, and for how long.

## In your browser

The editor, the docs and practice work without an account and without a
server. What they remember stays in your browser's storage on this device:

| Key | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `proschi.docs` | Your diagrams in the editor: their text, file names and which one is open |
| `proschi.docs.sync` | Cloud sync, signed in: which account it syncs with, whether you turned it off, per diagram the version your account has and a fingerprint of its content then (to tell what changed since), and which diagrams in this browser you have not (yet) agreed to add to the account |
| `proschi.playground.source` | A diagram saved by an older version of the editor, read once to carry it over |
| `proschi.practice` | Practice progress: per problem, your latest design, how many times you ran the tests and whether you solved it |
| `proschi.practice.runs` | Per problem: how many test runs, the runs it took to solve it, and the monthly cost of your cheapest solving design and of the reference solution, for the badges on a copy of the site without accounts |
| `proschi.achievements` | Badges earned on a copy of the site without accounts: which, when, and when the page showed them to you |
| `proschi.cards` | Daily review, on a copy of the site without accounts: every card review (which card, your rating, when, how long it took and your local date) |
| `proschi.cards.outbox` | Daily review, signed in: reviews not yet sent to the server, kept until it answers |
| `proschi.solves` | On a copy of the site without accounts: the local date you first solved each problem, for the daily streak and its badges |
| `proschi.challenge` | The daily challenge, on a copy of the site without accounts: each day's result (your answers, how long each took, the points, and your local date, for the daily streak) |
| `proschi.challenge.guest` | The daily challenge, signed out: the last one you played (answers, times, points and the card reviews it made), so it can be saved to your account when you sign in |
| `proschi.challenge.progress` | The daily challenge you are in the middle of: the day, your answers so far and how long each took, so a reload carries on where you were; removed when you finish |
| `proschi.game.meta` | Scale or Fail, signed out: your progress (Blueprints, unlocks, perks, the furthest wave and highest difficulty per scenario, what you have seen) |
| `proschi.game.outbox` | Scale or Fail, signed out: your finished runs (their moves), purchases and equipped perks, sent to your account when you sign in and then removed |
| `proschi.game.run` | Scale or Fail: the run you are in the middle of (its setup and your moves so far), so a reload carries on; removed when it ends |
| `proschi.game.daily` | Scale or Fail, signed out: the day and score of the last daily run you played |
| `proschi.game.settings` | Scale or Fail: sound on or off, and the run's speed |
| `proschi.game.days` | Scale or Fail, on a copy of the site without accounts: how many runs you finished on each local date (the last 400 days), for the daily streak |
| `proschi.goal` | On a copy of the site without accounts: your daily goal, in cards a day |
| `proschi.recap` | The week of the last weekly recap you dismissed, so it is not shown again |
| `proschi.onboarding` | Which first-run tours you have seen, the Arcade's first-wave tutorial and its intro to the twists included (in session storage when local storage is blocked) |
| `proschi.theme` | Light, dark, or following your system |
| `proschi.chunkReloadAt` | Session storage only: when the page last reloaded itself after a site update, so it never loops |
| `proschi.metrics.once` | Which usage counts this browser has already sent where one counts only once (below): in local storage for the first edit and a first solve signed out (with the problem's id), in session storage for the rest. Never sent anywhere |

Clearing the site's data in your browser removes all of it. Apart from the
theme, the docs pages and their live examples store nothing.

**Share links** carry the whole diagram in the part of the address after
`#`, which browsers never send to a server. Whoever you give a link to can
read the diagram; nobody else sees it. The same goes for an embed made
signed out (`/embed/#code=…`).

**Short links** (`/s/<id>`, signed in only) are different: the diagram is
stored on the server, below.

**Share buttons** (a daily run, a solve, a badge, a profile) only hand text
to your device's share sheet or clipboard; nothing is sent to us or to
anyone else until you paste it somewhere. A badge's share text links to your
public profile, so it is offered only while your profile is public.

## No tracking

No analytics, advertising or tracking scripts, no third-party cookies, and
no requests to other sites: fonts and scripts are served by proschi.app
itself, and every page's Content-Security-Policy forbids loading them from
anywhere else.

## Usage counts

To know whether the site is useful (do people who open the editor go on to
edit? do people who start a problem solve it?), proschi.app counts how many
times a day each of these happens:

| Count | When |
|---|---|
| `landing_view` | The home page is opened (once per browser tab session) |
| `editor_open` | The editor is opened (once per session) |
| `editor_first_edit` | The first edit in the editor (once per browser, ever) |
| `simulation_run` | The editor's Results or HLD tab or the load overlay is first shown (once per session) |
| `test_run` | The tests of a practice problem are run, or the editor's Results tab is first shown in a session |
| `share_link_created` | A share link is copied |
| `export` | A diagram is downloaded (image, `.proschi` file, backup) or copied as Mermaid |
| `practice_open` | The practice page is opened (once per session) |
| `problem_start` | A problem is opened (once per problem and session) |
| `problem_solve` | A problem is solved for the first time: signed in, counted by the server once it verified the solve; signed out, sent by the page (once per problem and browser) |
| `card_review_session` | A daily review session is finished |
| `challenge_complete` | A daily challenge is finished |
| `arcade_run_start`, `arcade_run_end` | A Scale or Fail run starts, ends |
| `sign_in` | Someone signs in (counted by the server) |
| `email_opt_in` | Someone asks for email reminders on the account page (a confirmation link is sent) |
| `email_reminder_sent` | Reminder emails sent (counted by the server, how many each hour's run sent) |

**What is sent and kept**: the page sends only the names of these events
(`POST /api/metrics`), a few at a time. The server adds them to one number
per day (UTC) and event, e.g. `2026-10-06, editor_open, 412`, and keeps
nothing else: no user id even when you are signed in, no IP address, no
cookie or device id, no page address or referrer, no problem id, no time of
day. Your IP address is used only for the minute-long rate limit that keeps
the counts from being flooded, and is never written down. Because a count
cannot be traced back to anyone, it is not part of **Download my data** and
stays when you delete your account. The daily counts are kept for 400 days,
then deleted.

**Turning it off**: the page sends nothing when your browser sends Do Not
Track or Global Privacy Control. Copies of the site without accounts (such as
a local build) never send anything.

## With a practice account

On [proschi.app](https://proschi.app/practice/) you can sign in with GitHub or
Google to keep practice progress and your diagrams across devices, see how
others did and make short links to diagrams.
Without signing in, nothing about you reaches the server (the usage counts
above are about events, not about you).

**What is stored**

- Your account: the sign-in provider and the user id it gives Proschi, a
  display name (your GitHub login or Google first name, which you can
  change), whether you chose to appear on the leaderboard, and when the
  account was created.
- Sessions: a hash of each session's cookie, with when it started and when
  it expires. A session lasts 30 days and renews while you use it; expired
  ones are deleted daily.
- If you sign in to a Proschi app on a phone: a hash of each of its tokens
  (an access token that lasts an hour and a refresh token that lasts 60
  days), with whether it is the site's cookie or which app token it is, when
  it was issued, when it expires and, for a refresh token, when it was
  exchanged for new ones. Rotated refresh tokens are kept until they expire,
  to notice a stolen copy being used. During sign-in a hash of a one-time
  code, which the app exchanges for its tokens within 60 seconds, is kept
  with the app's address to return to. Expired ones are deleted daily.
- Practice progress, per problem: how many times you ran the tests, your
  latest design, when you first ran and last ran it, when you solved it and
  in how many runs and on which local date, the cost and p99 of your best
  solving designs (as the server measured them) and when each was reached,
  and the simulation and problem versions it was recorded
  under. When you sign in,
  designs in your browser that your account lacks are uploaded to it, and the
  server re-runs their tests before it counts a solve.
- Daily review, per card review: which card (and its version), your rating
  (again, hard, good or easy), when, how long you took to answer and your
  local date; and per card the schedule computed from them (when it is due
  next and how well you know it). Reviews made signed out stay in the page
  and are gone when you close it.
- Your daily goal (cards a day). The daily streak and the weekly recap are
  computed from your card reviews, solve dates, daily challenges and game
  runs (by the local date each was sent on, kept with them); nothing more is
  stored for them.
- The daily challenge, per day you play it: when you saw its first card,
  your answers to its five cards,
  how long each took, which were right, the points, the score, when you
  sent it and your local date then. Your rank is computed from everyone's scores each time it is
  shown. A challenge played signed out stays in your browser until you sign
  in, when it is saved to your account.
- Scale or Fail, the system design game: your progress (Blueprints,
  unlocks, perks, the furthest wave and highest difficulty per scenario, the
  cards and incidents you have seen) and every run you submit: its scenario,
  seed, loadout, the moves you made, the score, when you played and your
  local date then. Runs
  played signed out stay in your browser and are sent when you sign in.
- Your diagrams in the editor, while cloud sync is on (it is, once you
  sign in, until you turn it off in the editor's Diagrams menu): each one's
  file name, text and the imported files a share link brought, a version
  number and when it last changed. The diagrams already in your browser are
  uploaded when you first sign in. They are private: they never appear on a
  profile or a leaderboard, and only you can read them. Deleting a diagram
  leaves a marker (its id, version and when) for 30 days, so your other
  devices delete their copy too; its text is removed at once. Your account
  keeps at most 5 diagrams for now (a paid plan will raise that), 64 KiB
  each; the others stay in your browser only, marked "This browser only" in
  the Diagrams menu, and are never lost. **Move to this browser only** in
  that menu takes a diagram out of your account (and your other devices) to
  free a slot. Turning sync off keeps the copies in your account until you
  choose **Delete my cloud copies** in the same menu.

  **Shared computers.** The browser remembers which account its diagrams
  were synced with. When a different account signs in, the diagrams synced
  with the previous one are removed from this browser (they are safe in that
  account) and nothing of it is uploaded to the new one. Other diagrams in
  the browser (never synced, or with edits the previous account never
  received) stay, and are added to the new account only if you answer yes to
  "Add N diagrams from this browser to your account?" (at most as many as
  your account has room for). Signing out gives you
  the choice: **Sign out** keeps the synced diagrams in this browser (the
  default, as before), **Sign out and remove synced diagrams from this
  browser** removes them (edits not yet saved to your account stay).
- Short links, each one you make with Share → Short link with preview (or
  Share → Embed, signed in): the diagram's text and the files it imports,
  its title, a PNG preview of the diagram that your browser rendered (none
  if it could not), and when you made it. **Anyone with the link can open
  the diagram and its preview**, without an account; the link's id is ten
  random characters, so it can't be guessed, but treat it like the diagram
  itself. Your name is not shown with it. Share → Your short links lists
  and deletes them; a deleted link stops working at once, though chat apps
  and link previews that already fetched the preview may keep their copy.
- Achievements: which badges you earned, when, and when the page first
  showed them to you. The skill map and the badges are computed from the
  reviews and progress above each time you open them; nothing else is
  collected for them.
- Only if you ask for email reminders: your email address and its settings
  ([Email reminders](#email-reminders), below).

**What is not stored**: your email address (unless you opt in to email
reminders), your avatar, and the access
tokens GitHub or Google hand over during sign-in (they are used once, to
read your user id and name, and dropped). Proschi asks GitHub for no
permissions beyond your public profile, and Google for `openid profile` only.

**Cookies**: `__Host-proschi_session` keeps you signed in (HttpOnly, sent
only to proschi.app). `proschi_oauth` lives for ten minutes during sign-in to
tie the provider's answer to your browser. Neither is used for anything else.
An app sends its access token with each request instead of a cookie; when
it signs in through your browser, no session cookie is set there.

**Logs**: each request to the server is logged with a request id, its
method, path (never the query), status, duration and, when signed in, your
user id. The logs live in Cloudflare Workers Logs and are kept for
Cloudflare's retention period.

**What others see**: practice statistics are aggregates over everyone, such
as how many solved a problem and how your design's runs, cost and p99 compare.
Your display name and number of solved problems appear on the leaderboard,
your display name and the monthly cost and p99 of your best solving designs
on each problem's leaderboards,
your display name and daily challenge score on that day's challenge
leaderboard, and your display name and best game score on the game's
leaderboards, only if you opt in ("Show me on the leaderboard", in the account
menu or on your profile page). Without it, your challenge score and your best designs still count
toward the number of players and everyone's ranks, but your name is never
shown.

**Your public profile**: opting in also makes a public profile, linked from
your name on either leaderboard, at an address with your user id
(`proschi.app/u/<your id>`). That address can be shared and found by search
engines, and its link preview (the page's title, description and a picture
card) shows your display name, how many problems you solved, your badge
count, your current streak and your interview-ready score, all from the
list below. The profile shows exactly this, and nothing more:

- your display name, and the month you joined;
- the problems you solved (which ones and their difficulty, never your
  designs);
- your current and longest daily streak, in days;
- your current and longest daily challenge streak, in days, and your best
  daily challenge score;
- your interview-ready score and your mastery of each topic, in whole
  percent;
- the badges you earned, with the day each was earned.

Your designs, your daily goal, your card reviews and when you made them, how
many cards you reviewed, your daily challenge answers, your test runs and
their costs, your sign-in providers and your sessions are never on it. Turning the option off hides the profile at once:
its address then answers "not found", the same as an address no user has, so
nobody can tell whether you have an account. Its picture card stops being
served at once too, but link previews that a chat app or social network
already fetched are kept by them, beyond our control.

## Email reminders

Signed in, you can ask for reminders by email on your account page
(`#/me`). It is off until you turn it on, and nothing is emailed until you
follow the confirmation link sent to the address (it works for two days).

**What is stored**, in one row per account, and nothing else:

- your email address, and when you confirmed it (empty until you do) and
  when the last confirmation email was sent;
- your browser's time zone (such as `Europe/Berlin`), read when you enter the
  address, so reminders arrive in your evening and the recap on Monday
  morning;
- which reminders you want: streak at risk, cards due, weekly recap;
- a random secret for the unsubscribe link in each email;
- the last reminder sent: your local date, the time and which kind (for the
  one-a-day limit), how many were sent in a row with no practice in between,
  and when reminders were paused for that reason;
- when the row was made and last changed.

**What it is used for**: only to send these reminders, at most one a day:
your streak would end today and today's goal isn't met (in your evening),
5 or more review cards are due (in your evening, when no streak reminder was
sent), and last week's recap (Monday morning). Whether one is due is worked
out from the practice data above, at the time. After three reminders in a
row with no practice in between, they pause (the third email says so) until
you resume them on your account page. Your address is never shown to anyone,
never used for anything else and never given to anyone else. The emails are
sent through Cloudflare Email Service, which handles the address only to
deliver them; they carry no tracking pixels and no tracked links.

**How long, and how to remove it**: until you remove it. Every email has an
unsubscribe link (also offered by your mail app as a one-click
"Unsubscribe"), which deletes the row at once; so do **Remove address** on
your account page and deleting your account. Changing the address replaces
the old one, which then needs confirming again. Log lines of the hourly
reminder run hold your user id, never the address, when a send fails.

## Your controls

In the account menu on the practice page:

- **Download my data** saves everything stored about you as JSON, your
  synced diagrams included, every session with its kind (the site or an
  app) but never the token hashes; short links come with their diagrams and
  the address of each preview, and email reminders with their address and
  settings (the unsubscribe secret stays out).
- **Delete my cloud copies**, in the editor's Diagrams menu once cloud sync
  is off, removes every diagram from your account; those in your browser
  stay.
- **Delete account** removes your account, sessions (apps' too), progress, card
  reviews, daily challenge results, badges, game progress, short links,
  synced diagrams and the email reminders' address from the server at once;
  the progress and diagrams in your browser stay.
  The database's point-in-time recovery history (Cloudflare D1 Time Travel)
  still holds them for up to 30 days, after which they are gone.
- **Sign out everywhere** ends every session, on every device, signed-in
  apps included.

The server is the open source [backend](../backend/README.md), so all of
this can be checked in the code. Questions go to
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/gvart/proschi/issues).
